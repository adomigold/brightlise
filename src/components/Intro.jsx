                        Your child is someone very special and we take care, value, and nurture each individual childâ€™s
                        development, learning and achievement. We provide a warm welcome for you and your child every day.
                        It can be difficult to decide what is best for your child but at Lise Day Care Centre, we truly believe
                        that children and parents deserve only the very best. We would love to have the opportunity to work and
                        grow with you and your child.
